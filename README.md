## What a credit rating is NOT?

A credit rating does not reflect other types of risk, such as market or liquidity risks, which may also affect the value of a security.  Nor does a credit rating consider the price at which the security is offered or sold. ** *****You should not interpret****** a credit rating** ***** ***as investment advice and should not view it as a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities*** .

A credit rating is not a guarantee that a financial obligation will be repaid.  For example, an ‘AAA’ credit rating on a debt instrument does not mean the investor will always be paid—instruments rated at this level sometimes default.

## Potential Conflicts of Interest

Many credit rating agencies—including the largest agencies—are paid by the obligors they rate or by the issuers of the securities they rate.  This creates a potential conflict of interest in that the credit rating agency may be influenced to determine more favorable ( *i.e.* , higher) ratings than warranted to retain the obligors or issuers as clients and to obtain new obligor or issuer clients.

Alternatively, some credit rating agencies are paid by subscribers to their ratings services, which are usually investors.  Investors’ desire for low or high credit ratings, depending on their holdings and trading positions, may also present a conflict of interest.

NRSROs are required by law to disclose these potential conflicts of interest.  NRSROs are also required to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures to address and manage these potential conflicts of interest.
